# Special-Topic-Machine-Learning

This project investigates scalable Bayesian inference using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). 
The aim is to compare SGLD with classical MCMC methods and evaluate its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware learning on larger datasets.
This mini-project was completed during the Michaelmas term as part of the Machine Learning module in my MSc programme.
